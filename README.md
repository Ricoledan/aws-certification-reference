## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- Pay-As-You-Go Pricing
- Can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need

## Deployment Models of the cloud

### Private Cloud

- cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to public
- complete control
- security for sensitive applications
- meet specific business needs

### Public Cloud

- cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delievered over the internet

### Hybrid Cloud

- keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud
- control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### On-demand self service

- users can provision resources and use them without human interaxction from the service provider

### Broad network access

- resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

### Multi-tenancy and resource pooling

- multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

### Rapid elasticity and scalability

- automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- quickly and easily scale based on demand

### Measured service

- usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expence (OPEX)

  - pay on-demand: don't own hardware
  - reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)

- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
- Stop guessing capacity
  - scale based on actual measured usage
- Increase speed and ability
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

## Problems solved by the Cloud

- Flexibility: change resource types when needed
- Cost-Effectiveness: pay as you go, for what use
- Scalability: accomodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- Elasticity: ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers
- Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

## Types of Cloud Computing

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
  - provide building blocks for cloud IT
  - provides networking, computers, data storage space
  - highest level of flexibility
  - easy parallel with traditional on-premise IT
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
  - removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  - focus on the deployment and management of your applications
- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - completed product that is run and managed by the service provider

## Example of Cloud Computing Types

- Infrastructure as a Service:
  - Amazon EC2 (AWS)
  - GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
- Platform as a Service:
  - Elastic Beanstalk (AWS)
  - Heroku, Google App Engine, Windows Azure
- Software as a Service:
  - Many AWS services

## Pricing of the Cloud -- Quick Overview

- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals (pay-as-you-go)
  - Compute:
    - pay for compute time
  - Storage:
    - pay for data stored
  - Data transfer OUT of the cloud
    - data transfer IN is free
- solves the expensive issue of traditional IT
