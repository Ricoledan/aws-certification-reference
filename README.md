## What is Cloud Computing?

- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- Pay-As-You-Go Pricing
- Can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need

## Deployment Models of the cloud

### Private Cloud

- cloud services used by a single organization, not exposed to public
- complete control
- security for sensitive applications
- meet specific business needs

### Public Cloud

- cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delievered over the internet

### Hybrid Cloud

- keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud
- control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
- flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

### On-demand self service

- users can provision resources and use them without human interaxction from the service provider

### Broad network access

- resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

### Multi-tenancy and resource pooling

- multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

### Rapid elasticity and scalability

- automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- quickly and easily scale based on demand

### Measured service

- usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

- trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expence (OPEX)

  - pay on-demand: don't own hardware
  - reduced total cost of ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)

- Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
